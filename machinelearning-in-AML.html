            Financial Institutions around the world spend <strong>millions if not billions of dollars</strong> on hiring resources or outsourcing the work of <strong>manual investigation</strong> of the alerts generated by the <strong>traditional rule based system.</strong> as to comply with Anti Money Laundering Regulations imposed by the respective regulators.
          </p><br>
          <p>Global financial services companies will pay <strong>$180.9 billion in compliance</strong>  costs for year 2020, according to a new report from LexisNexis Risk Solutions.</p>

          <img class="project-img" src="icons/question.svg"/>
          <p>
            Currently many of the organizations are using a tradional <strong>rule based </strong> alert system which is essentiallly just a set of rules and if the account satisfies those rules then an alert will be generated and the account will be sent to a <strong>human FinCrime Analyst</strong> for investigation. A human investgator spends an <strong>hour</strong> to investiagte the case on an average invbolving many <strong>repetative tasks</strong>. A huge problem faced by the institutions is the number of <strong>false positive </strong> and accourding to some of the reports <strong>75-90%</strong> of the cases which are investigated by human analyst upon a alert generated by rule based alert system.

          <p>
            Okay so we now have an understanding of the problem and now lets discuss how we can try to solve the problem.
            
        
        </p> <br>
        <p>We are trying to devlop a <strong>supervised</strong> machine learning algorithm with an aim <strong>not to </strong> replace the conventional rule based syatem but to reduce the number of <strong>false positive </strong> that is we are trying to decrease the number of fasle positive cases by training the machine learning model by the dataset which is generated by properly solved cases by a human analyst so that we have good quality dataset to train our model. The idea is to take solved cases which was triggered by rule based alert system and as the traning data and not to directly impliment the ML algorithm on the system.  The goal is <strong>not to eliminate</strong> but to <strong>make the existing system BETTER.</strong>
        </p>

            <h1>What will be the<span class="heading-inverted"> IMPACT!?</span></h1>
          <img class="project-img" src="icons/impact.svg"/>
          <p>
            The fact that this algorithm is aimed to reduce number of false positive cases is the reason that institutions now a days are more inclined to upgrade their existing alert system and to <strong>save millions on dollars in operations </strong> and this algorithm will prove as a great tool to achieve this goal.
